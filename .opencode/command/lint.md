description: lint the code and fix any errors
---

Run `make lint` to lint the project.

If any problems or errors occur, fix them and rerun `make lint` until all
problems and errors are fixed.

If you cannot fix a problem or error by the third iteration, abort and report to
the user about the problem.

When all problems and errors are fixed, output "Linted :)"
